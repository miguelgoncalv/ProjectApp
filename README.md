Developing an online shopping app on Android Studio can be very challenging due to several factors, in this project in questions the whole class got stucked multiple times for errors or mistakes faced during the development, it was clearly something above the knowledge of the class and it was quite challenging to finish without giving up. One of the main problems faced it was the user interface design since creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface design for an online shopping app can be extremely challenging, especially considering the variety of screens (login, sign up, cart, profile, orders, products) and functionalities involved.
In this project it was necessary to work with some colleagues from the class to overcome some challenges, since it was not the expertise of no one us this subject, and the requirements of the assignment it was extremally above the learning curve of the class who clearly has struggled to finalize even the last project. 
Android Studio is a very powerful application that can be overwhelming for beginners and the learning curve can be slow since to  use the various features and tools of the IDE can be challenging.
Debugging is an essential part of app development, and beginners may find it challenging to locate and fix errors in their code. In this Project one of the main issues faced it was to debug the app, since many errors were founded frequently, and it wasn’t necessarily easy to understand or of fix it. 
Compatibility it also an issue for finalizing the app. Ensuring that the app worked on different devices and platforms wasn’t a pleasing task. Beginners may not be aware of the nuances of different devices and platforms and may struggle to make their app compatible with them.
As conclusion, this was a very unique project to work on it, it was clearly not easy but many things were learned and achieved after the app finally worked.
